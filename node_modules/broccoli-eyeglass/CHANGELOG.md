# 1.2.4

* Eyeglass 0.8 deprecated several APIs, this release upgrades eyeglass
  and uses the new, undeprecated APIs. No API changes to
  broccoli-eyeglass at this time.

* Use node-sass 3.4.2 now that regressions have been fixed.

# 1.2.3

* Lock down node-sass to 3.3 until node-sass regressions in 3.4 can be fixed.

# 1.2.2

* Fix bug where only the first asset location is registered.
