# Tables

## Borderless

Tables are a great way of displaying options and data semantically. However,
we often don't need to display any borders between our items.

```html
<table class="o-table-borderless">
  <tr>
    <th>First name</th>
    <th>Last name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
