# Widths

At Sky we design to a 12-column grid, however that's [not a one-size-fits-all 
solution](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/).

When it comes to writing your layout, select one with the number of columns you
**really need**. For example, there’s no point in using a 12-column grid if your
layout only needs 3 or 4 columns.

By default, Toolkit surfaces the following width utilities from [Supercell](https://github.com/sky-uk/supercell#usage):

| Fraction | Classes                                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Whole    | `.u-width-1/1`                                                 |
| Halves   | `.u-width-1/2`                                                 |
| Thirds   | `.u-width-1/3`, `.u-width-2/3`                                 |
| Quarters | `.u-width-1/4`, `.u-width-2/4`, `.u-width-3/4`                 |
| Fifths   | `.u-width-1/5`, `.u-width-2/5`, `.u-width-3/5`, `.u-width-4/5` |
| Sixths   | `.u-width-1/6`, `.u-width-2/6`, `.u-width-3/6`, `.u-width-4/6`,|
|          | `.u-width-5/6`                                                 |

The above values meet the vast majority of our use-cases, and are are completely 
**customisable**. Override `$global-widths` to meet your project's preference:

```scss
// This would *only* generate `.u-width-×/12`s
$global-widths: 12;
@import "sky-toolkit-core/all";

// or

// This would generate *all* fractions up to `.u-width-×/12`s
$global-widths: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12;
@import "sky-toolkit-core/all";
```

These utilities aren't tied exclusively to
[Layout](https://github.com/sky-uk/supercell#usage); they can be applied 
anywhere.

## Responsive

Width classes can be set to trigger at any of our breakpoints, following a 
**mobile-first** approach. Add the prefix `@breakpoint-name` to the end
of your class.

For example, the markup below will result in:

* Full width by default
* Half width at the `medium` breakpoint
* Quarter width at the `large` breakpoint

```html
<div class="o-layout">
  <div class="o-layout__item u-width-1/1 u-width-1/2@medium u-width-1/4@large">
    Example layout element
  </div>
</div>
```
